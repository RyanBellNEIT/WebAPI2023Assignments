        I am not sure what you meant by "why you picked the topic" so I am writing a paragraph on why I picked to do game development as my major. 
        Starting off, games have always been a part of my life since I was a kid.
        I remeber my first gaming console and playing Minecraft, GTA, etc. 
        Looking back, those were some of my best' moments I had as a kid. 
        It made me fall in love with video games as whole and I always thought how it was really cool
        seeing some of the video game giants and how they were made.
        Seeing the process of how video games went from simple boxes to these giant massive multi-million dollar
        projects made me really interested in becoming a game developer. So when I saw that NEIT had a game development major, I knew
        thats what I wanted to do.
